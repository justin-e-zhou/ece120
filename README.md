# ECE 120 FALL 2018 COURSEWORK
## ABOUT
Introduction to digital logic, computer systems, and computer languages. Topics include representation of information, combinational and sequential logic analysis and design, finite state machines, the von Neumann model, basic computer organization, and machine language programming. Laboratory assignments provide hands-on experience with design, simulation, implementation, and programming of digital systems. 

## TOPICS COVERED
- Representation of information
- Boolean algebra
- Combinational network analysis and design
- Sequential network analysis and design
- Computer organization and machine-level programming
- Programming in C

## COURSE GOALS
As an introductory course to digital logic, ECE 120 demonstrates the relation between Boolean algebra as a formal framework for describing real-world problems, circuits implementing Boolean expressions that can be simulated using digital design software, and digital circuits physically built with TTL chips. By using the three modalities (Boolean expressions, circuit drawings and simulations, and actual hardware implementation), students are exposed to the digital systems design cycle, from the problem formulation stage to the actual hardware implementation and verification stage.

As an introductory course to computer systems, ECE 120 shows the relation between the hardware, software, and the interface between them. The students are exposed to computer microarchitecture, they have hands-on experience in programming using binary machine instructions and in the assembly language. This sets the stage for ECE 220 course in which the students learn programming using high-level languages.
